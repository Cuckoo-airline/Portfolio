Hello!
Here is three projects:

1. Steel temperature prediction - the final project of my DS course. It perfecly shows my meticulousness in data preprocessing and ML skills.
2. Customer churn forecasting - it's more about statistical analysis and data preparation (fighting class imbalance, encoding).
3. Taxi Demand Forecasting - less voluminous then another two, specific about time series.
